# Crisp

A proof of concept web framework built on top of
[https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-webserver]("basic-webserver").

The framework is based on how [https://gleam.run/](gleam)'s web framework
[https://hexdocs.pm/wisp/](wisp) works. Especially the way it handles middleware.
It uses gleam's use expressions, which translates very well to roc's backpassing.

## Proof of concept

Since this is just a proof of concept, I am not planning to turn this into a
production ready web framework. I do invite anyone to fork this repo and turn
it into something bigger!
